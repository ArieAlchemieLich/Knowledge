# Color Space

## Mechanism

Human eye can detect light in the visible spectrum.  
But human only have three types of cone cell, which are red, green, blue.  
Thus, when there are lots of lights combined with different wavelength, human brain will interpolate the color between red and blue.  
However, if a wavelength of a light is combined with red and blue, the problem is that the color should not be green.  
To deal with this problem, human brain create Magenta.
